## So, What is this?
This web app maps tidal harmonics to MIDI values to facilitate the creation of unique and interesting musical compositions. It provides a number of simple tools to help shape the output: global tempo control, a simple step sequencer, the ability to center and control the range of values around a particular note. It also allows you to output to individual MIDI channels and the ability to send note data or control channel data. You can send data to other software on the host through an internal MIDI bus like Logic Pro X and Pro Tools, or output to an external device like a Euro Rack modular system.

## What are Tidal Harmonics?
Tides are created by the gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun, acting upon the waters of the Earth. Those gravitational forces change as the relative positions of the Earth, Sun, and Moon change. Each of these motions or “constituents” can be described mathmatically as a cosine curve.
